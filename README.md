# persistence
The function persistence takes a positive parameter integer and returns its multiplicative persistence, the number of times its digits are multiplied until a single digit is reached.

For example (Input --> Output):

39 --> 3 (because 3*9 = 27, 2*7 = 14, 1*4 = 4 and 4 has only one digit)

999 --> 4 (because 9*9*9 = 729, 7*2*9 = 126, 1*2*6 = 12, and finally 1*2 = 2)

4 --> 0 (because 4 is already a one-digit number)
